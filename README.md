Most food review websites and apps focus on restaurant reviews or homemade recipes. Dish-it brings restaurant dishes to the spotlight, even if theyâ€™re not the biggest names or spend the most on advertising. Use it to discover new dishes around your area or friend group, get visual representations of menu items while out and journal your visits, saving reviews and photos. This app was developed with a group of fine gentlemen during the last few weeks of the UNC Coding Bootcamp. Enjoy!
